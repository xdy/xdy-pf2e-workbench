## How to contribute to xdy-pf2e-workbench

Make an issue if you have ideas or have found bugs, or a pull request if you have code or documentation. If you have submitted a PR it's probably a good idea to ping me in the #pf2e-modules channel of the [Pathfinder 2e Game System discord](https://discord.gg/Dv8YkbHZqM) as well.

If you see an already existing issue you would like to tackle, ping me in a comment on the issue first.

Do note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project. (
TL/DR: [Be excellent to each other!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rph_1DODXDU))

Also note that all contributions must adhere to the licenses mentioned in the [README](README.md) and not otherwise
break any relevant (or irrelevant) law...

## To contribute translations
To help translate an existing language, or to add support for a new language, do one of the following:
* Use the Pf2e Workbench [gitlocalize]([https://gitlocalize.com/repo/7104](https://weblate.foundryvtt-hub.com/projects/xdy-pf2e-workbench/)) to translate the project into your language. [See their instructions]([https://docs.gitlocalize.com/how_to_contribute.html](https://weblate.foundryvtt-hub.com/)) or for a new language, ask for it to be added on the discord so you can translate it on gitlocalize.
* Send me a completed translation file for your language and ask me to add it to the system (e.g. by copying en.json to xx.json (replacing xx with the language code of the language you want to translate to), and translating only the text to the right of the colon for each line)
* If you are comfortable with Github, after translating, instead of just sending the file, make a Pull Request, making sure to also add your system to "languages" in system.json before you do the Pull Request. (See below for instructions).

Or, if you prefer to do it as a separate module, make sure to ping me so I can link to it here!

## How to set up for development

1. Fork project in github
1. Clone project to your local working directory
1. Do one of the following:
1. Copy the file foundryconfig.example.json to foundryconfig.json and edit the new file to point to the appropriate
   directory. 1. Windows example of foundryconfig.json contents:
    ```
    {
    "dataPath": "C:\\Users\\jk\\AppData\\Local\\FoundryVTT",
    }
   ```
  1. Mac/unix example of foundryconfig.json contents:
      ```
      {
      "dataPath": "/Users/xdy/Library/Application Support/FoundryVTT",
      }
      ```
1. Symlink dist directory to your Foundry data directory. 1. Mac/unix example:
    ```
    ln -s /Users/xdy/Projects/FoundryVTT/xdy-pf2e-workbench/dist "/Users/xdy/Library/Application Support/FoundryVTT/Data/xdy-pf2e-workbench"
    ```
  1. Windows example (add /h to mklink to get a hard link rather than a soft link):
      ```
      mklink /d C:\Users\jk\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data\modules\xdy-pf2e-workbench C:\Users\jk\foundryvtt\xdy-pf2e-workbench\dist
      ```
1. Do the following each time you have updated your fork and want to test your code:
1. Builds the prerequisites
   `pnpm install`
1. Runs the module in 'developer mode', watching for changes in the code as they happen
   `pnpm run build:dev`

## Coding conventions

In order to keep to sane coding standards - aka the ones I prefer :) - please use eslint with the included settings
whether directly supported in your IDE, or run manually on the command line before you make your Pull Request.

* You may also need a plugin/integration to support eslint. See https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations for
  where to find that for your editor/IDE. (Though, you can of course run eslint manually before committing if you
  prefer.)
* Depending on your editor/IDE you may have to install a plugin/integration for .editorconfig to be supported.
  See https://editorconfig.org/ for details and where to find that for your editor/IDE. (It is more important that you
  use eslint, but if your editor only supports .editorconfig at least indenting etc will use the right setting.)

## When it's time to do your Pull Request

* Name the Pull Request beginning with WIP until you think it is in a good shape to be merged.
* Make sure eslint has been run with no complaints on your code.
* Squash any merge commits and other cruft. Aim for one commit per feature or issue that your Pull Request tackles.
* If any of the checks on the Pull Request fails, try to fix them, or ask for help if you can't figure out what's wrong.
* When you're done, note in the Pull Request and/or on the Discord that there is a Pull Request that you consider ready
  to be merged, and remove the WIP from the beginning of the Pull Request name.
* If your Pull Request completes an issue, include a line like 'Fixes #nnn' in the description, replacing nnn with the
  actual issue number.

## If you're changing items in compendiums
Example for 'xdy-pf2e-workbench-items' below, replace with the appropriate pack name.

If you have cloned the git repo, and done an install and config of [fvtt-cli](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli):
* Start a world in Foundry with the Workbench active
* Edit the items in the compendium
* Exit the world (stop Foundry if you're paranoid)
* Run 
```fvtt package unpack "xdy-pf2e-workbench-items" -v```
* Copy the json files from 
```$FOUNDRYDATAPATH\modules\xdy-pf2e-workbench\packs\xdy-pf2e-workbench-items\_source```
 to the appropriate directory in your git repo
* Make a new branch for the PR (or do it on main, you do you, but you'll suffer later...)
* Commit the files
* Push
* Wait for me to merge the PR
* PROFIT! ðŸ™‚
